# A2C Stats Revamp

This is a quick continuation of a [project](https://github.com/randomaccount1293/a2c-stats-2023) that I did 2 years ago in 2023. There is a lot more documentation on what is actually being done to the data and more data anonymization practices have been put into place for the final generated data. 

The original data set is in this repository since it is public information, and it is important if you want to regenerate the data yourself. 

Have fun data analyzing!
