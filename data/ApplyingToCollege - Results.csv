GOO WOLVERINES!!!!

Kind of ironic how I fell in love with UMich in Grade 8(those were the times I didn't know Yale or Brown existed) when I first realized I wanted to study in the USA. Over the years, Yale, Princeton, and Brown got me more excited while UMich remained a soft spot. 

Well, here I am now. Back to where I started.","","alpham (43),alphai (25),alphac (25),alphah (25),🇮 (22),alphag (22),alphaa (22),alphan (22),🎉 (22),❤️ (11)"

It's been a long grind with many highs and lows as an international who knew nothing about this process when I stumbled across some youtube videos a few years back (college decision reaction videos into A2C kid pipeline is real). It's unreal to me to finally to reach the end of this incredible journey.
